## Features

1. **Intro Screen**: Welcomes users with a captivating background video.
2. **Login & Registration**: Sleek UIs ready to be integrated with backend functionality in the future.
3. **Home Screen**: Central hub to see popular categories and top-selling groceries. 
4. **Cart Screen**: Displays products added to the cart and syncs with the backend server.
5. **Category Screen**: Browse products by categories fetched directly from a dart_frog server.
6. **Search Screen**: Search interface to be integrated with search functionality in future updates.
7. **Order History**: UI to display historical orders of logged-in customers. 
8. **Order Status**: Monitors the currently active order status, from rider pickup to delivery

## Current State

- The Login, Registration, Search screen, Order History and Order Status are currently UI-only and lack backend functionality.
- Products and categories data are fetched from the backend server powered by Dart Frog
- Cart functionality is fully operational and syncs with our Dart Frog server to ensure consistent product availability and data.
- The backend server doesn't interface with any external databases yet. Database integration is slated for future updates.

## Future Updates

- Integration of backend functionality for the Login, Registration, and other screens.
- Synchronization of the dart_frog server with an external database. 
- Product barcode scan feature
- Server and database deployment to Google Cloud Platform
